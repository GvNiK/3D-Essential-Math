This project focuses on understanding math with unity. It uses visualization to help understand concepts and see the output better.

**1. Dot Product**
- Dot product is usefult to calculate wheter an object is front or back of the subject.

- An Editor tool to help understand the dot product easily through visualization.

- Another example to know wheter the character was hit from front or behind? 

**2. Math around Circle**
- Below are some practices done to better understand trigonometry. Mainly around circles and lines.

![Incrementing Radius](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29335d3b-9344-45a9-bb00-490aa5ec9a86)
- This is an example of an object moving in a circular movement with an offset. The object is highlighted using red green color. Additionally a GameObject Sphere is also added on the trajectory showing that a gameobject can be attached and moved on the circular path.

- This is an example of an object moving in a circular movement with an offset. Offset object is highlighted using red color.
